* Racing Line Simulator in Python
I wanted to remake [[https://github.com/mcardoff/Racing_Line_Optimizer][the Swift version]] of this project in python, to see if it was any more difficult to do.

The same class structure is implemented, however there is also a clear difference in the fact that there is no UI in this version, hopefully this will change in the near future!
