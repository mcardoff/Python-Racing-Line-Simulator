* Racing Line Simulator in Python
I wanted to remake [[https://github.com/mcardoff/Racing_Line_Optimizer][the Swift version]] of this project in python, to see if it was any more difficult to do.

The same class structure and methodology is implemented, however there is also a clear difference in the fact that there is no UI in this version, hopefully this will change in the near future!

** Running
If you have multiple =python= versions installed you may need to run 
#+begin_example
python3 main.py
#+end_example
But if =python= 3 is the only version you have, the following should work fine:
#+begin_example
python main.py
#+end_example
